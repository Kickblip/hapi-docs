# Human-Aware Planning and Interaction Lab Documentation

This is a documentation site meant for internal use at CSU's Human-Aware Planning and Interaction (HAPI) Lab. The site was built using the [Just The Docs](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs-template) Jekyll theme and is hosted on GitHub Pages. To edit pages on this site, add or change markdown files in the `/docs` directory. Be sure to follow the header format in each markdown file you add and be sure to use standard formatting conventions throughout your page.

## Building and previewing your site locally

Assuming [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) are installed on your computer:

1.  Change your working directory to the root directory of your site.

2.  Run `bundle install`.

3.  Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to build your site and preview it at `localhost:4000`.

    The built site is stored in the directory `_site`.
