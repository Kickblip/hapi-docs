# Unity-ROS Communication

Setting up the communication layer between ROS 2 Foxy and Unity so we can send ROS messages between Unity and the robot.

This guide will soon be changed as we move from running ROS 2 Foxy in a Docker container to running ROS 2 Galactic locally alongside the rest of the Interbotix packages.
{: .warning }

## Installing Unity

Download the Unity Hub setup file from the official Unity CDN

https://public-cdn.cloud.unity3d.com/hub/prod/UnityHub.AppImage

Ensure the App Image file is executable

```bash
chmod +x path/to/UnityHub.AppImage
```

Open the **App Image** file (this may take a few minutes) and follow the instructions to install the latest Unity Editor version (at least 2020.X.X).

## Setting up ROS 2 Foxy

We will use a Docker image from the Unity Robotics Hub GitHub repository to install ROS 2 Foxy. Our development machines run Ubuntu 18.04, if you are running Ubuntu 20.04 or later, you can run Foxy without using Docker.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install snapd
sudo snap install docker
```

Clone the repository that contains the necessary files.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Unity-Robotics-Hub.git
```

Navigate to the directory `tutorials/ros_unity_integration` and run the following command to build and start a Docker image.

```bash
sudo docker build -t foxy -f ros2_docker/Dockerfile .
sudo docker run -it --rm -p 10000:10000 foxy /bin/bash
```

Run the server endpoint. Because we are using Docker, you can safely replace `<your IP address>` with `0.0.0.0`

```bash
ros2 run ros_tcp_endpoint default_server_endpoint --ros-args -p ROS_IP:=<your IP address>
```

We will also open a second terminal tab (`shift+ctrl+T`) to run additional commands later.

```bash
sudo docker ps
```

This will show you the currently running Docker containers. Initialize a second terminal with

```bash
sudo docker exec -it <container name> bash
```

You should now have two terminal tabs connected to the same Docker container

## Setting up Unity

Launch Unity and create a new 3D project.
Open the Package Manager window under the "Window" tab at the top of the editor
Click the + button at the top left corner. Select "add package from git URL" and enter "https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ROS-TCP-Connector.git?path=/com.unity.robotics.ros-tcp-connector" to install the [ROS-TCP-Connector](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ROS-TCP-Connector) package.

![add_package_2](https://github.com/Kickblip/ROS-NGC/assets/54160850/4e220f5b-f7df-4e88-a074-c31b8c3b533a)

Open ROS Settings under the new "Robotics" tab at the top of the editor and change the protocol to ROS 2.

![ros2_protocol](https://github.com/Kickblip/ROS-NGC/assets/54160850/a83d3850-b9a6-407c-b819-227e4be04b93)

Again, under the "Robotics" tab, click `Generate ROS Messages....`. In the Message Browser window, click the Browse button at the top right and set the ROS message path to `tutorials/ros_unity_integration/ros_packages/unity_robotics_demo_msgs`. This directory path can be found **in the Unity Robotics Hub repository you downloaded earlier**.

In the message browser, expand the `unity_robotics_demo_msgs` subfolder and click "Build 2 msgs" and "Build 2 srvs" to generate C# scripts from the ROS .msg and .srv files.

![generate_messages_3](https://github.com/Kickblip/ROS-NGC/assets/54160850/be7f8357-87c3-467f-b48e-e9794fc73551)

## Creating the Unity publisher

In your Project tab in Unity, create a new C# script in the `assets` folder and name it `RosPublisherExample`. Paste the following code into the new script file.

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using Unity.Robotics.ROSTCPConnector;
using RosMessageTypes.UnityRoboticsDemo;

public class RosPublisherExample : MonoBehaviour
{
    ROSConnection ros;
    public string topicName = "pos_rot";

    // The game object
    public GameObject cube;
    // Publish the cube's position and rotation every N seconds
    public float publishMessageFrequency = 0.5f;

    // Used to determine how much time has elapsed since the last message was published
    private float timeElapsed;

    void Start()
    {
        // start the ROS connection
        ros = ROSConnection.GetOrCreateInstance();
        ros.RegisterPublisher<PosRotMsg>(topicName);
    }

    private void Update()
    {
        timeElapsed += Time.deltaTime;

        if (timeElapsed > publishMessageFrequency)
        {
            cube.transform.rotation = Random.rotation;

            PosRotMsg cubePos = new PosRotMsg(
                cube.transform.position.x,
                cube.transform.position.y,
                cube.transform.position.z,
                cube.transform.rotation.x,
                cube.transform.rotation.y,
                cube.transform.rotation.z,
                cube.transform.rotation.w
            );

            // Finally send the message to server_endpoint.py running in ROS
            ros.Publish(topicName, cubePos);

            timeElapsed = 0;
        }
    }
}
```

Add a plane and a cube to your Unity scene. You can create simple geometric shapes in Unity by going to the Hierarchy window, clicking the + button, and navigating to the shape you want to create.

![create_cube](https://github.com/Kickblip/ROS-NGC/assets/54160850/ffedba52-14e0-440b-b1a9-829225ac0e1f)

1. Click the cube in your scene and use the vertical arrow to move it up until it is hovering above the plane

2. Create another **empty** GameObject, name it `RosPublisher` and attach the `RosPublisherExample` script by dragging the C# file onto the object.

3. Drag the cube GameObject onto the Cube parameter in the empty GameObject's inspection window.

4. Press play in the Editor. You should see the connection lights at the top left corner of the Game window turn blue, and something like `[INFO] [1622242057.562860400] [TCPServer]: Connection from 172.17.0.1` appear in the terminal running your server_endpoint.

## Echo the publisher

To make sure messages are being published from Unity correctly, run the following commands in the second tab of you Docker container (the one that is **not** running your server)

```bash
source install/setup.bash
ros2 topic echo pos_rot
```
