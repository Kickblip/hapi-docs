# Installing the Interbotix ROS Package Suite

This guide covers the steps necessary to install and build the `interbotix_ros_rovers` package to start developing on the LoCoBot. This guide is made for ROS 2 Galactic running on Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal).

## Installing ROS 2 Galactic

The following ROS installation steps are from the [Official Galactic Installation Guide.](https://docs.ros.org/en/galactic/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html) Refer there for more detail.

1. Verify locale settings (mainly for minimal environments like a Docker container).

```bash
locale  # check for UTF-8

sudo apt update && sudo apt install locales
sudo locale-gen en_US en_US.UTF-8
sudo update-locale LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 LANG=en_US.UTF-8
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8

locale  # verify settings
```

2. Ensure that the [Ubuntu Universe repository](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Ubuntu) is enabled.

```bash
sudo apt install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository universe
```

3. Add ROS 2 GPG key with apt.

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl
sudo curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.key -o /usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg
```

4. Add the repository to your sources list.

```bash
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg] http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu $(. /etc/os-release && echo $UBUNTU_CODENAME) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2.list > /dev/null
```

5. Update your apt repository caches after setting up the repositories.

```bash
sudo apt update
```

6. ROS 2 packages are built on frequently updated Ubuntu systems. It is always recommended that you ensure your system is up to date before installing new packages.

```bash
sudo apt upgrade
```

7. Install ROS 2 packages.

```bash
sudo apt install ros-galactic-desktop
```

8. Open your `.bashrc` file with a text editor.

```bash
cd
nano ~/.bashrc
```

9. Add the following lines to the bottom of the file.

```bash
alias galactic='source /opt/ros/galactic/setup.bash'
export INTERBOTIX_XSLOCOBOT_BASE_TYPE=create3
```

10. Restart your `.bashrc` to reflect these changes.

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

Now you can source your ROS environment in a new terminal by simply typing.

```bash
galactic
```

11. Install and initialize Rosdep

```bash
sudo apt install python-rosdep
sudo rosdep init
rosdep update
```

12. Now we will install Colcon (the ROS 2 build tool).

```bash
sudo apt install python3-colcon-common-extensions
```

13. And finally, we will initialize our Colcon workspace.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/colcon_ws/src
```

## Installing `interbotix_ros_rovers` Package Dependencies

The four main Interbotix packages are dependent on eachother in the following way:

```
interbotix_ros_rovers
  └── interbotix_ros_toolboxes
  └── interbotix_ros_core
      └── interbotix_ros_xs_driver
```

**NOTE:** This tree is just a way to show dependencies, all these packages will go in `~/colcon_ws/src`.

1. Install `interbotix_ros_toolboxes` package in your `~/colcon_ws/src` directory.

```bash
git clone -b galactic https://github.com/Interbotix/interbotix_ros_toolboxes.git
```

2. Install the required C++ YAML parser.

```bash
sudo apt-get install libyaml-cpp-dev
```

3. Install the `interbotix_ros_core` package.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Interbotix/interbotix_ros_core.git -b galactic
```

4. Initialize the `dynamixel_workbench_toolbox` package.

```bash
cd interbotix_ros_core
git submodule init interbotix_ros_xseries/dynamixel_workbench_toolbox/
git submodule update
rm interbotix_ros_xseries/COLCON_IGNORE
```

5. Install Missing dependencies (these were the ones I needed to install, it may be different for other systems).

```bash
sudo apt install ros-galactic-dynamixel-sdk ros-galactic-gazebo-ros-pkgs ros-galactic-tf-transformations ros-galactic-ros2-control ros-galactic-ros2-controllers
```

6. Add the `interbotix_xs_driver` drivers package to your `~/colcon_ws/src`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Interbotix/interbotix_xs_driver.git
```

7. Now build your workspace from `~/colcon_ws` (the root of your workspace) to make sure everything is working.

```bash
galactic
rosdep update
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y --rosdistro=galactic
colcon build
```

8. If the build was successful, it is time to install all the LoCoBot packages. Clone the following repo into your `~/colcon_ws/src` directory.

```bash
git clone -b galactic https://github.com/Interbotix/interbotix_ros_rovers.git
```

9. And finally, try to build the workspace once more.

```bash
cd ..
colcon build
```

If you are getting errors regarding missing paths, try deleting the `install` and `build` directories from your workspace and rebuilding.

```bash
rm -rf install build
colcon build
```

## Installing Even More Dependencies

1. Since our LoCoBot is using a Create3 base, we're going to need some packages from the `create3_sim` repo to simulate it in Gazebo. Clone the following repository **somewhere other than your Colcon workspace directory (for example, your desktop)**.

```bash
git clone -b galactic https://github.com/iRobotEducation/create3_sim.git
```

2. From this new directory, drag the `irobot_create_common` and `irobot_create_gazebo` packages into your `~/colcon_ws/src` directory.
3. Now, staying in your `~/colcon_ws/src` directory, clone the following packages.

```bash
git clone -b galactic https://github.com/iRobotEducation/irobot_create_msgs.git
git clone https://github.com/Slamtec/sllidar_ros2.git
```

4. Now we will install some missing dependencies from the ROS package manager. Similar to before, these were the ones I had to install, I'm not sure if it will be the same for every device. These also don't seem to be picked up by `rosdep update` for whatever reason.

```bash
sudo apt install ros-galactic-gazebo-ros2-control ros-galactic-rtabmap-ros ros-galactic-joint-state-publisher ros-galactic-joint-state-publisher-gui ros-galactic-nav2-bringup ros-galactic-rplidar-ros ros-galactic-realsense2-camera ros-galactic-moveit
```

5. Now run Rosdep to check for more missing dependencies. If it says there are missing dependencies, try installing them from the ROS package manager (like above) or searching for them on GitHub. Run the following command from `~/colcon_ws` not `~/colcon_ws/src`

```bash
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y --rosdistro=galactic
```

6. If there are no missing dependencies, try to build your workspace.

```bash
colcon build
```

If you are getting errors regarding missing paths, try deleting the `install` and `build` directories from your workspace and rebuilding.

```bash
rm -rf install build
colcon build
```

## Launching Gazebo Simulation

1. First, we need to make sure that the Gazebo environment is being ran on every new terminal window. Open your `.bashrc` file with a text editor.

```bash
cd
nano ~/.bashrc
```

2. Add the following line to the bottom of the file.

```bash
. /usr/share/gazebo/setup.sh
```

3. Restart your `.bashrc` to reflect these changes.

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

4. Now you can either launch Gazebo and Moveit simultaneously using this command:

```bash
ros2 launch interbotix_xslocobot_moveit xslocobot_moveit.launch.py robot_model:=locobot_wx200 use_lidar:=true hardware_type:=gz_classic
```

Or you can just run Gazebo without a Moveit instance.

```bash
ros2 launch interbotix_xslocobot_sim xslocobot_gz_classic.launch.py robot_model:=locobot_wx200
```

I've found that as a general rule, if you're having trouble with Gazebo, the first thing you should try is to kill all client and server instances. If Gazebo is not opening for you, try running the following command.

```bash
killall gzserver gzclient
```
